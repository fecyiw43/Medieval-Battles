The project is a game where 2 players can pick their "heroes" and battle each other out
To Run the game, compile main.cpp using the makefile by typing "make box"
There are probably many issues with my code, as this is the first ever game I tried to create after learning C++ for a short period of time
I hope you enjoy the game!
